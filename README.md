# APCJ40_MKII
by chris joseph

A custom remote script for the APC40 MKII for Ableton Live 11. For Ableton Live 10 please see: https://github.com/CJmusic/APC40_MkIIx

Changes:

- nudge + + copies a clip
- nudge + - deletes a clip
- shift + nudge now nudges
- shift + bank turns on VU meters
- user mode is a step sequencer
- shift + clip view is undo
- shift + detail view is redo
- shift + record is capture midi
- press and hold select clip to expand or collapse a group

Known Bugs:

- Velocity slider doesn't work (it doesn't play the note at that velocity, but it sequences it at it)
- Pads are always lit upon disconnect, velocity slider pads always lit (issue is with the make_button command ControlElementUtils.py)
- The loop selector isn't working
- the Playhead isn't showing up
- VU meters doesn't navigate around with sessions view (as a workaround you can press shift to "refresh" the VU meters tracks)
